00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.120
Ever since you came into my view

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.640
the world changed completely

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.200
And in the midst of all the flawless time I spent

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.500
it’s breaking apart in a strange gravity

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.300
“I love—” but I stop saying in mid-sentence

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.220
“I love”, “I love”, so many times

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:10.680
In the midst of a growing love, of changing feelings, you shine brilliantly

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:21.260
Irregular, like paints diving into a water tank and melting

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.160
I wouldn’t have even noticed

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
these vivid colors if I was alone

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.720
You feigned ignorance, said it’s normal

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:50.960
—so let me finish what I started saying to you—“I love—”

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.920
I don’t understand how you smile at invisible things

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.840
So beautiful you make me dizzy

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.620
I’m still living with a sense of inferiority

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.080
I love, I love—a clumsy knot

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.640
I love, I love—fumbling around for it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.240
I love your love—untie it, entwine it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.740
I repeat it over and over

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:52.600
In a galaxy decorated with replicas, in a darkness made by curtains

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:06.880
No-one lamenting in the gray city—I love, hold tight to the evidence

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.040
Happiness, sadness, and unpunctuated thoughts

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.820
I hope we can agree even if we’re unsure

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.640
even more than sharing them completely

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:37.280
In overlapping love, in fuzzy emotions, in the brief span of a blink

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:46.040
The present you gave me is this awfully kind world

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.980
Irregular

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:59.600
I wouldn’t even had noticed this gentle light if I was alone

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.240
You feigned ignorance, said it’s normal

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:17.260
—so let me finish what I started saying to you—“I love—”

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:30.900
We accept each other as this nameless night goes on
